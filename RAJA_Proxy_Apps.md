# RAJA Proxy Applications

Each proxy application available in this project is contained in its
own subdirectory. 

These applications have been released individually and contain their own 
license and release information.

## LULESH v1.0

LULESH v1.0 (Livermore Unstructured Lagrangian Explicit Shock Hydrodynamics)
is a proxy app that models a Sedov blast wave using an explicit Lagrangian
hydrodynamics algorithm on an unstructured mesh. It was developed 
originally by:

* Jeff Keasler (keasler1@llnl.gov)
* Rich Hornung (hornung1@llnl.gov)

Details about LULESH v1.0, including versions implemented in a variety
of programming models, can be found at 
[https://codesign.llnl.gov/lulesh.php](https://codesign.llnl.gov/lulesh.php).

Depending on CMake configuration options you provide, this repository
can generate sequential and OpenMP baseline versions (i.e., non-RAJA) and
RAJA versions for sequential, OpenMP, and CUDA GPU execution. In addition,
the RAJA-based code contains a header file called `luleshPolicy.hpp` that
can be used to generate a variety of OpenMP and CUDA implementations by
defining different RAJA execution policies for the loops in the code. To
explore these variants, please consult that file and choose the desired
use case via the `-DUSE_CASE=<int value>` CMake option.

By default, each version of LULESH v1.0 included here runs the
Sedov problem to a pre-defined end time and reports execution timing,
a figure of merit (FOM) grind-time, and verification that the solution is 
correct. Command line arguments allow one to optionally:

 * set a fixed number of time cycles to run
 * set the number of elements in the mesh 
 * print run progress that reports information about each time cycle. 

To get information about runtime options, run an executable with the 
`-h` option.

## LULESH v2.0

LULESH v2.0 is an extension of LULESH v1.0. LULESH v2.0 also models a Sedov 
blast wave using an explicit Lagrangian hydrodynamics algorithm on an 
unstructured mesh.

It was extended from LULESH v1.0 by:

* Ian Karlin (karlin1@llnl.gov)
* Jeff Keasler (keasler1@llnl.gov)
* Rob Neely (neely4@llnl.gov)

Details about LULESH v2.0 can be found at
[https://codesign.llnl.gov/lulesh.php](https://codesign.llnl.gov/lulesh.php).
[LULESH 2.0 Updates and Changes](https://codesign.llnl.gov/pdfs/LULESH2.0_Changes.pdf) describes how LULESH v2.0 is different that LULESH v1.0.

Depending on CMake configuration options you provide, this repository
can generate sequential and OpenMP baseline versions (i.e., non-RAJA) and
RAJA versions for sequential, OpenMP, and CUDA GPU execution. 

By default, each version of LULESH v2.0 included here runs the
Sedov problem to a pre-defined end time and reports execution timing,
a figure of merit (FOM) grind-time, and verification that the solution is 
correct. Similar to LULESH v1.0, command line arguments allow one to 
optionally:

 * set a fixed number of time cycles to run
 * set the number of elements in the mesh 
 * print run progress that reports information about each time cycle. 

In addition, command line options are provided for:

 * setting the number of material regions
 * setting load imbalance and cost parameters between regions
 * generating output files for visualization with VisIt

To get information about runtime options, run an executable with the 
`-h` option.
