LULESH v1.0
===========

Computer simulations of a wide variety of science and engineering problems
require modeling hydrodynamics, which describes the motion of materials
relative to each other when subject to forces. Many important simulation
problems of interest to DOE involve complex multi-material systems that undergo
large deformations. LULESH is a highly simplified application, hard-coded to
only solve a simple Sedov blast problem with analytic answers â€“ but represents
the numerical algorithms, data motion, and programming style typical in
scientific C or C++ based applications.
